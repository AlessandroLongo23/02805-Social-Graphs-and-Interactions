    "Using the genres to subdivide the artists network into communities might initially seem a reasonable idea. However, by using the modularity measure, the analysis must be conducted using only one genre as label for each artist/band, greatly weakening its potential, since most artist/bands contain multiple genres in their wikipedia infobox.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover \"rock-related\" genres like hard rock, alternative rock, etc... are by far the most frequent among all artists, realistically rendering the subdivision into distinct communities infeasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the two main reasons listed above, applying different criterions to choose the genre among the ones listed in the infobox would probably not solve the issue.\n",

    "TF-IDF is a measure developed in order to evaluate the importance of a term to a document in a collection of documents. It is the product of two main parts:\n",
    "- $\\text{tf}(t, d)$ (term frequency): it measures how frequent a term $t$ is in a document $d$;\n",
    "- $\\text{idf}(t, D)$ (inverse document frequency): it measures how frequent a term $t$ is in the whole collection of documents $D$;\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to calculate both $tf$ and $idf$, but the crucial concept is that $\\text{tf-idf} = \\text{tf} \\cdot \\text{idf}$ takes into consideration both the importance of a word in a specific text, and the overall frequency of that word across all documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is thus possible to grasp the true nature of a text. In our case, it is possible to produce a description of a musical genre made up of the most important words to that genre."
