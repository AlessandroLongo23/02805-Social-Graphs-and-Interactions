    "This week we'll talk about advanced network measures (beyond the degree distribution). We will use these tools to make sense of the network of the Rock Musicians on Wikipedia. \n",
    "This is the outline for today:\n",

    "* Visualization and qualitative analysis of the Rock Music Artists Network\n",
    "* Properties of the network structure\n",
    "* Finally some more visualizations\n",

    "> _Reading_: This week, the reading is mostly for reference. It's for you to have a place to go, if you want more detailed information about the topics that I cover in the video lectures. Thus, I recommend you check out **Chapter 9** of the network science book. In particular, we'll delve into Section 9.4 in the exercises below. We will also talk a little bit about degree correlations - you can read about those in **Chapter 7**."

    "*Exercise 3:* Last time we visually analyzed (plotted) the degree distributions of our network. Now, let's analyze it using some of the tools from previous lectures. For this exercise we are going to look at the *directed* graph (rememeber, we asked you to keep one?).\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. What are the average, median, mode, minimum and maximum value of the in-degree? And of the out-degree? How do you intepret the results?\n",
    "> 2. Let's also look at the *[exponent of the degree distribution](http://networksciencebook.com/chapter/4#degree-exponent)* \n",
    ">    * To calculate it, you can install [`powerlaw`](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0085777) package (I could not install in conda, so I used `pip install powerlaw`)\n",
    ">    * Use `powerlaw.Fit(degree).alpha` for fitting\n",
    ">    * Find the degree exponent for in-, out- and total- degree distribution. Think about what you learned in the book - what does each exponent say about our network?\n",
    ">    * When analyzing the plots of in- and out- degree distribution last week, did you come up to the same conclusions?\n",
    ">    * Reflect on the whole power-law thing. Are the degree distributions even power laws? Could a log-normal or exponential distribution be better? How would you find out what the right function to describe the various degree distributions are? \n",
    ">    * A long time ago, a group of scientists analyzed the network spanned by **all** of Wikipedia (the paper is called [Wikipedias: Collaborative web-based encyclopedias as complex networks](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.74.016115); to access this paper, use findit.dtu.dk or read the preprint on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0602149)). Do your findings correspond to the results described in Chapter **III.A** of that paper? If not, try to give your explanation of why? \n",
    "> 3. Plot a heatmap [(Hint here)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2369492/generate-a-heatmap-in-matplotlib-using-a-scatter-data-set) of the the in- versus out- degree for all characters. Zoom in on just the in-degree $[0,20]$ and out-degree $[0,20]$ area of the plot. What is the advantage of using a heatmap over the scatter plot from the previous Exercise (especially for understanding what's going on in this area)?\n",
    "> 4. Why do you think I want you guys to use a directed graph? Are there questions we can ask using the directed graph that are not possible to answer in the undirected version? Which questions? Can you think of examples when the in/out distinction doesn't matter.\n",
    "> 5. We have one more metric that we have used, but not investigated so far. The node-attribute `length_of_content`. There are two things to look at.\n",
    ">    * Firstly, we can verify that more text means more links. If that's true the length should correlate with out-degree. Does it? \n",
    ">    * Secondly, and more interestingly, it could be that longer texts means *more famous* characters. And that means more in-links. \n",
    ">    * How should you test this? Well, here you are allowed to be **creative**. You may choose the method of your liking to study this question (e.g. look at it visually, test the correlation using [spearman](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.spearmanr.html) or [pearson](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.14.0/reference/generated/scipy.stats.pearsonr.html) correlations, fit a curve to the data, you decide). Are both questions true? If yes, which phenomenon is stronger? Explain your results in your own words.\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "For this exercise, I also hope you'll limit your LLM use. Especially for the intrepretation parts. It's OK to get help for the heatmap in sub-part 3, maybe also for ideas of how to do the testing in part 5. But do your own interpretation :)\n",

    "One method to clean up the \"hairball\"-looking networks, is known as the [backbone method](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0808904106). Sometimes this method is also called the \"disparity filter\". I explain what it's all about in the video below."

    "There are [many backbone extraction algorithms](https://www.michelecoscia.com/?page_id=287), and I've chosen to talk about the *Disparity Filter* here, because it's the oldest and most commonly used method (so I though you should know about it). Plus, it'll probably be the relevant method for your project.\n",
    "\n",
    "This choice, however, presents us with a problem: As I explain in the video, the Disparity Filter method *only works on weighted networks*. But our network does not have edge weights in any kind of natural way (since there's usually just a single link between two wiki pages). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So to get rid of unimportant edges, we'll have to try something different. I present you with three possible methods below. For the first two ones, we'll add weights proportional to the [edge betweenness centrality](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/algorithms/generated/networkx.algorithms.centrality.edge_betweenness_centrality.html). The edge betweenness centrality is just like the node betweenness centrality that you know and love ... only that it's defined for *edges* instead of nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create two new weighted networks based on the edge betweenness\n",
    " * **Weighted Network 1**: The ***undirected*** Rock Music Network (Giant Connected Component) but with edge weights proportional to the edge betweenness centrality (let's renormalize so that the lowest weight is equal to 1 and the highest weight is equal to 100).\n",
    " * **Weighted Network 2**: The ***undirected*** Rock Music Network  (Giant Connected Component) but with edge weights proportional to 1/(edge weight in Weighted Network 1).\n",

You can implement the disparity filter yourself based on the [scientific paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0808904106) or find an implentation on GitHub (there are several ones to choose from ... I like [this implementation](https://www.michelecoscia.com/?page_id=287), which also includes other interesting edge filters). Figure out how your particular backbone extractor works (you may have to inspect the code itself, these packages are not always well documented). Play around with values of $\\alpha$ to get an aestetically pleasing visualization (but don't make the resulting network too sparse).\n",
    "> 2. Plot the resulting three networks using ForceAtlas2, still sizing nodes according to total degree. No need to color them. If your backbone has some disconnected nodes, feel free to not plot them. And remember to calculate a new layout to see how the structure has changed.\n",
    "> 3. Comment on your results\n",
    ">    * Do you see any structures in the networks now? Inspect some nodes to get a sense of what the structures captures in the three networks. Describe your findings in your own words.\n",
    ">    * Weighted network 1, 2, and 3 are very different. In 1 and 2, we have removed edges with low/high edge betweenness centrality respectively and HSH is based on shortest paths. What have the various filters done to the networks? Describe what you see visually, and your explain your thoughts on what we've done to the network structures.\n",

    "\n",
    "One final thing. For now, the backbones are mostly for visualization. Especially because the edge weights are a bit artificial. Generally, it's not exactly clear what kind of information we get rid off when removing the non-backbone edges -- and in our case it's even less clear because I've made up two of the methods. Thus, we'll still do the exercises during the following weeks using the full network that preserves all of the connection information.\n"
